# Guess The Video Game

One of the first games I developed, this app was a huge learning experience. Getting the letter to appear when and where I wanted was a challenge, but a welcome one and I'm glad I figured it out.

The game plays like hangman, minus the hanging. To start, press the start button on the remote. To reset the game, press the red reset button on the console. Turn your volume up to hear some theme music if you win.

This app was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
